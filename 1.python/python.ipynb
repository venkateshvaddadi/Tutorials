loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string). This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages. With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.\n","\n","Ref : [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp)"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"bQZVYRAxTH1i","outputId":"f6b5b031-d42f-488e-ec33-8fba28f7b0ad"},"source":["fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n","print(len(fruits))\n","\n","for x in fruits:\n","  print(x)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["3\n","apple\n","banana\n","cherry\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"cUzXdJ26zPeF","outputId":"87a3d33f-e5f5-4423-b7ba-4d197670c3b5"},"source":["for i in range(3):\n","  print(i)\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["0\n","1\n","2\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["len(fruits)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"yebztC4E_Wxo","outputId":"d90891f8-712e-4e7c-93f1-eb5d40f3f582"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["3"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"b2EDOq60CJXa","outputId":"c3cb5cdd-64b6-4a94-8a50-084bb5d6d7d0"},"source":["for i in range(len(fruits)):\n","  print(i)\n","  print(fruits[i])"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["0\n","apple\n","1\n","banana\n","2\n","cherry\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"H6H8cC2fTsTi","outputId":"905e9585-64de-41ff-f478-3a08d4e68720"},"source":["for x in \"banana\":\n","  print(x)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["b\n","a\n","n\n","a\n","n\n","a\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"xHEdaY7rTuVX","outputId":"88ef90ea-ddda-4fa8-93a0-f355e84bd914"},"source":["fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n","\n","for x in fruits[:\n","  print(x)\n","  if x == \"banana\":\n","    break"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["apple\n","banana\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"gLB6NDY8T2e1","outputId":"2eab7a0b-5223-4d82-d788-adc828004582"},"source":["fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n","for x in fruits:\n","  if x == \"banana\":\n","    continue\n","  print(x)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["apple\n","cherry\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"CHKcn-EAT5I0","outputId":"8c4673ef-1f3b-4913-c536-70254f82d29b"},"source":["for x in range(6):\n","  print(x)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["0\n","1\n","2\n","3\n","4\n","5\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"o75c2BACUDch","outputId":"c5d56b01-c452-4602-bac0-be4440333f84"},"source":["for x in range(2, 30, 3):\n","  print(x)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["2\n","5\n","8\n","11\n","14\n","17\n","20\n","23\n","26\n","29\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"rYE8rS-cUcZ2","outputId":"dd5758ad-abfc-4f59-d178-441ea01a5bad"},"source":["fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", 56, 'IISc']\n","\n","for data in enumerate(fruits):\n","  print(data)\n","\n","print(data)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["(0, 'apple')\n","(1, 'banana')\n","(2, 'cherry')\n","(3, 56)\n","(4, 'IISc')\n","(4, 'IISc')\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Exception Handling**"],"metadata":{"id":"QJYuK9sM_OxT"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["a = 10\n","b = 10\n","\n","while(True):\n","  try:\n","    x = a/b\n","    print(x)\n","    b = b-1\n","  except:\n","    print(\"Divide by 0 is not possible\")\n","    break"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ZkhsR59n_IxN","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1691747177421,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":339,"user":{"displayName":"Naveen Paluru","userId":"08627684292255422727"}},"outputId":"81d6c0e9-c2eb-43de-9497-78fa496ac020"},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["1.0\n","1.1111111111111112\n","1.25\n","1.4285714285714286\n","1.6666666666666667\n","2.0\n","2.5\n","3.3333333333333335\n","5.0\n","10.0\n","Divide by 0 is not possible\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"rd-i05LMU3JK"},"source":["# **Python Functions**\n","\n","A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
